The period from 1890 to 1920 marked a significant transformation in American society, as the nation grappled with rapid industrialization, urbanization, and waves of immigration. During this era, various reform movements emerged to address the social, economic, and political challenges facing the United States. The Progressive Era, as it came to be known, represented a broad-based effort to improve American democracy and society through government intervention and social activism.

The Progressive movement encompassed a wide range of reforms, from trust-busting and labor rights to women's suffrage and urban reform. Reformers sought to address corruption in government, improve working conditions, and expand democratic participation. Key figures like Theodore Roosevelt, Jane Addams, and Upton Sinclair advocated for change through different approaches, whether through political leadership, social work, or investigative journalism.

Labor reform was a central concern of the Progressive Era. The growth of industrial capitalism had created harsh working conditions, long hours, and dangerous environments for workers. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911 highlighted the need for workplace safety regulations, while strikes and labor organizing demonstrated workers' demands for better treatment. Progressive reformers supported legislation to limit working hours, establish safety standards, and protect workers' rights to organize.

Urban reform also gained momentum during this period. Rapid urbanization had created overcrowded cities with poor sanitation, inadequate housing, and limited public services. Settlement houses, established by reformers like Jane Addams, provided social services and education to immigrant communities. Municipal reforms aimed to improve city government efficiency and reduce corruption through initiatives like the city manager system and direct democracy measures.

Women's suffrage represented another major reform movement of the era. Activists like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had laid the groundwork for women's voting rights in the late 19th century, and the movement gained significant momentum during the Progressive Era. The National American Woman Suffrage Association and other organizations mobilized support for the 19th Amendment, which was ratified in 1920.

The Progressive Era reforms had lasting impacts on American society. Government regulation of business increased, workplace safety improved, and democratic participation expanded. However, the reforms also had limitations, particularly regarding racial equality and immigration restrictions. Overall, the Progressive Era represented a crucial period in American history when citizens organized to address the challenges of modern industrial society.
