a) One major difference between the economic systems of the North and South was their labor systems. The North developed a wage-labor industrial economy with factories employing free workers, while the South maintained an agricultural economy dependent on enslaved labor for plantation production of cotton, tobacco, and other cash crops.

b) The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 by Eli Whitney contributed to the economic differences by making cotton production extremely profitable in the South. This technological development increased demand for enslaved labor to work cotton plantations, reinforcing the South's agricultural slave-based economy while the North continued industrializing with free wage labor.

c) The economic differences contributed to political tensions through conflicts over the expansion of slavery into new territories. Northern industrial interests opposed slavery's expansion because it would compete with free labor and limit markets for manufactured goods, while Southern agricultural interests demanded slavery's expansion to maintain political power and economic growth, leading to crises like the Missouri Compromise and Compromise of 1850.
