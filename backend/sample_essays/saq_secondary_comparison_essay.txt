a) One major difference between Adam’s understanding and Rush’s understanding is that Adam’s believes that freedom was ‘in the minds of the people’ long before the idea of war or revolution even mentioned, referring to the acts placed on the colonists after the previous war that brought frustration to colonist groups, whilst bringing prosperity to British groups. On the contrary, Rush believes the war is a ‘great drama’ and the reform of new government has yet to benefit the peoples needs and ways of life. In addition to the previous statement, Rush believes that American war and Revolution do not in any way correlate.

b) There were plenty of things done further pioneering the long fight for freedom. One being the Olive Branch petition, one of the last peaceful attempts for freedom. After being massacred and minoritized by Britain powerful forces, colonists still wanted to try peace before war. However they were turned down and threatened by the King himself, as he mentioned anyone opposed to the enforcement of Britain would be ‘ hanged’. This enacted the battles to being due to the lack of freedom and right the colonist had, especially after the Boston massacre. Being taxed, silenced, and killed led to the the idea of revolution that later came to a war.

c) On the contrary, use believes the affects of the war played no part in the revolution that followed. Virtual representation could be a cause for this believe as they had no say in what happened to them or their family’s, displaying the lack of independence they had as a whole. The lack of say they had, to Rush, could have been the source for revolution and boundaries such as the articles of confederation, which also showed great weaknesses and ineffectiveness leading to the bill of rights.
