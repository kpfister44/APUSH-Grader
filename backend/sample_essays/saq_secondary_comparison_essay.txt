a) One major difference between the interpretations is their assessment of the New Deal's impact on economic recovery. Leuchtenburg argues that the New Deal was necessary and successful in saving American capitalism and preventing economic collapse, while Folsom contends that the New Deal actually prolonged the Depression by discouraging private investment and creating economic uncertainty.

b) The creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in 1935 could support Leuchtenburg's argument because it provided employment for millions of unemployed Americans, putting money back into the economy through government-funded infrastructure projects, arts programs, and public works that improved communities while providing immediate economic relief during the worst years of the Depression.

c) The continued high unemployment rates throughout the 1930s, which remained above 14% until 1940, could support Folsom's argument because despite massive New Deal spending on programs like the WPA and CCC, unemployment stayed persistently high, suggesting that government intervention was not effectively stimulating private sector job creation and economic growth.
