Use the excerpts below to answer all parts of the question that follows.

Excerpt 1:
"The New Deal was a necessary response to the Great Depression that saved American capitalism through government intervention. Roosevelt's programs provided essential relief to millions of unemployed Americans and implemented crucial reforms that prevented future economic disasters. Without the New Deal, the United States might have faced complete economic collapse and potentially turned toward more radical political alternatives."

Source: Historian William Leuchtenburg, "Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal" (1963)

Excerpt 2:
"The New Deal was an unnecessary expansion of federal power that actually prolonged the Great Depression. Roosevelt's interventionist policies discouraged private investment and created an atmosphere of uncertainty that hindered economic recovery. The economy only truly recovered when World War II created massive government spending on defense production, not because of New Deal domestic programs."
