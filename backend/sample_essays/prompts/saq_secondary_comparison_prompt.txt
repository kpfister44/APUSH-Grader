Excerpt 1:
"As to the history of the revolution, my ideas may be peculiar, perhaps singular. What do we mean by the revolution? The War? That was no part of the revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was in the minds of the people, and this was effected. from 1760 to 1775, in the course of fifteen years, before a drop of blood was shed at Lexington."

Excerpt 2:
"There is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American Revolution with those of the late American War. The American War is over: but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution. On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed. It remains yet to establish and perfect our new forms of government; and to prepare the principles, morals, and manners of our citizens, for these forms of government, after they are established and brought to perfection."
