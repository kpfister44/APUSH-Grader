# APUSH Grader Implementation Plan

## Migration Plan: iOS Frontend + Python Backend

**Current Status**: Phase 3 COMPLETE - iOS frontend successfully migrated to Python backend API, APUSHGraderCore removed

### Migration Rationale
Current Swift implementation is excellently architected but over-engineered for hobby project scope. Migration to Python backend provides:
- **Better Maintainability**: Python ecosystem easier than complex Swift/iOS
- **Universal Access**: Future web frontend expansion
- **Simplified Deployment**: Standard web hosting vs App Store complexity  
- **Preserved UI**: Keep polished SwiftUI interface

### Migration Timeline

**Phase 1: Backend Foundation**
- Python FastAPI project setup with models
- Migrate core business logic from Swift
- Comprehensive test suite (preserve 223 tests)
- Health check and validation endpoints

**Phase 2: API Development**  
- REST API endpoints (`POST /grade`, `GET /health`)
- AI service integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- Error handling and retry logic
- API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

**Phase 3: iOS Migration**
- Create HTTP client layer in iOS
- Simplify models to DTOs only
- Update ContentView and GradeResultsView
- Remove APUSHGraderCore dependencies

**Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**
- End-to-end integration testing
- Deploy to Railway hosting ($5-6/month)
- User acceptance testing
- Legacy code cleanup
