# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
APUSH Grader - Migrating from iOS SwiftUI app to **Python FastAPI backend + iOS frontend** architecture. Uses AI (OpenAI/Anthropic) to grade AP US History essays based on College Board rubrics.

## Target Audience and Scope
APUSH Grader is designed for a small handful of teacher to use it. Anywhere from 2-12 teachers. Prioritize simplicity over complexity whenever possible. Functionality is more important than comprehensiveness and minimize complexity wherever possible. This is NOT meant to be a full scale enterprise project that can support 1000's of users!

## Current Architecture Status
**Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Python backend with comprehensive API and testing
**Phase 2A COMPLETE**: Real Anthropic AI service integration implemented
**Phase 2B COMPLETE**: Production configuration, rate limiting, logging, and monitoring implemented
**Phase 2C READY**: Testing and documentation updates
**Legacy**: Swift Package (APUSHGraderCore) will be replaced by Python backend

                                      â†“
                              Production Features:
                              â€¢ Rate Limiting (20 req/min, 50 essays/hour)
                              â€¢ Structured Logging (JSON + correlation IDs)
                              â€¢ Usage Safeguards (100 essays/day, 50k words/day)
                              â€¢ Health Monitoring (/health, /health/detailed)
```

### **Next Steps**
- **Phase 2C**: Testing and documentation updates (optional)

- **Platform-Agnostic Design**: Backend ready for multiple frontends (iOS, web, etc.)
- **Production Ready**: Complete API with rate limiting, structured logging, usage safeguards, and health monitoring
- **Cost Protection**: Daily limits and usage tracking to prevent excessive Anthropic API costs
- **Operational Visibility**: Structured logging, correlation IDs, and health endpoints for monitoring
- **Teacher-Friendly**: Generous limits (100 essays/day) with user-friendly error messages
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Python ecosystem easier than complex Swift/iOS
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing components

## AI Configuration

### **Switching Between Mock and Real AI**

The system supports two AI service modes that can be configured via environment variables:

#### **Mock AI (Default - No API Key Required)**
```bash
# Default mode - uses realistic mock responses for testing
AI_SERVICE_TYPE=mock
```

#### **Real Anthropic AI (Requires API Key)**
```bash
# Real AI mode - uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for actual grading
AI_SERVICE_TYPE=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
```

### **Environment Configuration**
Create a `.env` file in the `/backend/` directory:
```bash
# For development with mock AI (default)
AI_SERVICE_TYPE=mock

# For production with real AI
AI_SERVICE_TYPE=anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key-here
```

### **AI Service Features**
- **Mock AI**: Provides consistent, realistic responses for all essay types (DBQ/LEQ/SAQ)
- **Anthropic AI**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model with temperature=0.3, max_tokens=1500
- **Seamless Switching**: Same API interface works with both mock and real AI
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback and user-friendly error messages
- **Testing**: All existing tests work with both AI service types

## Important Notes
- **Primary Development**: Focus on Python backend in `/backend/` directory
- **Production Ready**: Backend now includes rate limiting, structured logging, usage safeguards, and monitoring
- **AI Configuration**: Use mock mode for development, real AI for production (see AI Configuration above)
- **Testing**: Run `pytest tests/ -v` for comprehensive test suite (320+ tests)
- **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8000/docs when server is running
- **Monitoring**: Use /health/detailed and /usage/summary for operational visibility
- **Cost Protection**: Daily limits prevent excessive Anthropic API usage
- **Legacy Swift**: APUSHGraderCore still functional but will be replaced by backend API
